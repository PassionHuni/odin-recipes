    <H1><em>Ingredients</em></H1>
    <ol>
        <li>2 cups (480 ml) of raw almonds</li>
        <li>7 cups (1,680 ml) of filtered water plus more for soaking</li>
        <li>1 tsp (5 ml) of salt plus more for salting</li>
        <li>4 TBSP (60 ml) of fresh squeezed lemon juice (one medium size lemon)</li>
        <li>4 capsules probiotics with 15 billion CFU</li>
        <li>1/16 tsp (dash) of Penicillium Candidum</li>
        <li>1/16 tsp (dash) of Geotrichum Candidum</li></ol>
    <h1><em>Equipment</em></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A 4 inch springform or any round form that can be easily removed</li>
        <li>A container with a lid </li>
        <li>1-2 bamboo mat</li>
        <li>Some cheesecloth</li>
        <li>Some parchment paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><em>Directions</em></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the almonds with filtered water overnight</li>
        <li>The next day, dump the water and rinse well. Remove the almond skin (optional). Rinse again after removing the skin, and let it sit to air dry for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>In a blender, mix the almonds with filtered  water and salt. (I like to do half of them at a time as it is easy to blend.) Blend it on high speed until it’s very smooth, and strain it through a nut milk bag. Squeeze as much milk out as you can. Note: you can save the nut pulp and dehydrate it to make almond flour.</li>
        <li>Put the milk in a pot and cook it on medium to low heat. When it reaches a full boil, lower the heat and continue to cook it for 5 minutes before turning off the heat.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the lemon juice. From my experience, one medium size lemon makes about 4 TBSP (60 ml) of juice. </li>
        <li>Let the milk sit to cool for about 10 minutes, then add the lemon juice and mix well. Let the milk curdle for a few hours. Note: If you make the milk in the morning, it’s perfect as you can let it curdle until the evening. </li>
        <li>When the milk is curdled, gently scoop it through 2 layers of  cheesecloth in a strainer that has a container to catch the water underneath. Cover it and let the water separate overnight. You’ll have milk curd that’s ready for making the cheese the next morning.</li>
        <li>The next day, The milk curd is ready. Put the curd in a mixing bowl, add probiotics, Penicillium Candidum, Geotrichum Candidum, and mix well. Cover the bowl loosely and let it ferment at room temperature overnight.Note: The water doesn’t have a lot of flavor, but you can use it for smoothies or soup.</li>
        <li>The next day, sterilize a cheesecloth with boiling water and set it aside. Put a bamboo mat on the container’s lid or a tray, then put a bottomless springform on the mat. Line the sterilized cheesecloth in the form and fill it with the mixture.</li>
        <li>Lightly pack the mixture, fold the cheesecloth over and gently press down. Cover it and put it in a cool area at 53-56 F°</li>
        <li>Day 1, there is still excess water and the cheese is still very soft. Dump the water and dry the tray, then put the cheese back on the mat.</li>
        <li>Gently remove the form, and the cheesecloth. Sprinkle on some salt evenly, and put a piece of parchment paper on the cheese. Stabilize and carefully flip.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecloth and evenly sprinkle salt on this side too. Cover and put it back to the cool area.</li>
        <li>Day 2-5, flip it everyday. You can see the white mold starts to show by day 3. </li>
        <li>By day 6 or 7, the white mold should cover the whole cheese. Sometimes, the mold on the top and bottom is thinner than the side, and it’s normal.</li>
        <li>Use a bigger piece of paper to flip the cheese. Remove the mat and the paper. Wrap the cheese and put it in a breathable box or anything breathable to prevent the moisture, then put the cheese in the fridge for at least 2 days to age. I like to age my cheese for 3 days.</li>
        <li>After aging in the fridge, it’s time to enjoy it!</li>
