        <h1><em>Ingredients</em></h1>
        <h3><em>Pizza Crust</em></h3>
      <ul>  
        <li> 4C buckwheat sprouts (sprouted from 2C dry buckwheat)</li>
        <li>3C chopped carrots</li>
        <li>1C ground chia seeds</li>
        <li>4T coconut oil</li>
        <li>2T Italian herbs</li>
        <li>1t Celtic sea salt or pink salt</li>

    <h1><em>Directions</em></h1>
    <ol>
       <p> <li>Prepare buckwheat sprouts using the instructions above.</li>
        <li>Grind whole chia seeds to create a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Using a food processor, grind down the buckwheat sprouts (with salt, and herbs) until it forms a dough ball (this may take a minute or two); set aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Process the chopped carrots into a fine consistency.</li>
        <li>Mix by hand or process all ingredients (dough, carrots, chia and coconut oil) until thoroughly incorporated.</li></p>
        <p>
        <li>Place 1C portions onto a dehydrator non-stick sheet with a screen underneath for support. One crust per tray, four trays total, when using an Excalibur dehydrator.</li>
        <li> Flatten out into a rounded shape (about 1/8-1/4" thick) with a rolling pin or wet hands.</li>
        <li>Form a raised edge by lifting up and around the crust exterior. (optional)</li>
        <li>Dehydrate on medium heat setting for approximately 6-8 hours.</li>
        <li>After 3 hours remove non-stick sheet lining and keep pizza facing upright on the screen only.</li>
        <li>Continue to dehydrate until a dry, yet flexible crust-like texture is attained.</li></p>
